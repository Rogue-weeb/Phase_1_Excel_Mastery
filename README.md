Phase 1: Excel Mastery (Months 1–3)

*This repository documents my Excel mastery phase, focusing on professional data handling, automation, Power Query, VBA, and dashboard building.*

This phase will establishes Excel as my foundational data manipulation tool because it is the most accessible entry point for handling structured data, performing quick analyses, and automating repetitive tasks—skills that directly translate to data entry or junior data roles. Excel’s formula-based logic mirrors programming concepts that i'll encounter later in Python and SQL, reducing the cognitive load when transitioning. Mastering it first ensures i can immediately apply it to real-world tasks like data cleaning and reporting, building confidence and employability without requiring programming knowledge yet. 


***Prerequisites for advancing: Complete all projects; achieve 90%+ accuracy on practice exercises from specified resources; demonstrate ability to build a dynamic dashboard from raw data without external help. If unclear on any formula’s behavior, test it in a blank workbook before proceeding.***
